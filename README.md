## JQ-FormCreation Example

This is a example how you can use Typeform I/O to create typeforms based on
user data you already have. This is not a realistic example, but if you want to
start tinkering with our API using shell commands this is probably a good
starting point.



## Requirements

* The `jq` JSON processing shell utility
* An API-key from Typeform I/O (You can get one [here](http://docs.typeform.io/v0.1/page/signup))


## Installation

* Clone the project to your local machine
* When finished, run `./main.sh your_api_key` to run the application, replacing
 `your_api_key` with the API-key you have for Typeform I/O
